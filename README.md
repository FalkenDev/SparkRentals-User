## About
### Background
The web client for the user will be a website that primarily gives the customer an overview of their account, must allow the customer to edit their information, and to be able to top up their balance with prepaid cards. In addition to this, the customer must also be able to see all their travel history and also be able to navigate into specific trips to see details about it. The client will be built with ReactJs and retrieve data from our REST API. Tailwind will be used as CSS framework for the style.
